# Arduino Buzzer Tone Codes

Most of the codes are ready to be uploaded via Arduino IDE. Pin number for the buzzer is 10. 

## Note 

The classic guides on Arduino melody like [this guide on Arduino.cc](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/BuiltInExamples/toneMelody) and notes on [Play Arduino Piezo Music Codes](https://thecustomizewindows.com/2016/05/play-arduino-piezo-music-codes-fur-elise-jingle-bell/) not required to know. You may look at them for the circuit. The codes work with ESP32 as well. 

## Simulation on browser

You can play the tunes on Wokwi Arduino simulator. For example, @matititam created this intance of Jingle Bells with the above code : https://wokwi.com/arduino/projects/309974695864697409
