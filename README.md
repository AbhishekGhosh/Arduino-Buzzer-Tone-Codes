# Arduino Buzzer Tone Codes

Most of the codes are ready to be uploaded via Arduino IDE. Pin number for the buzzer is 10. 

## Note 

The classic guides on Arduino melody like [this guide on Arduino.cc](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/BuiltInExamples/toneMelody) and notes on [Play Arduino Piezo Music Codes](https://thecustomizewindows.com/2016/05/play-arduino-piezo-music-codes-fur-elise-jingle-bell/) not required to know. You may look them for connection. The codes work with ESP32 as well.
